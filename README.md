pyBgSetter: Multi-backend (feh, habak, ...) GUI Wallpaper Setter 
=============

This piece of software was announced on the Arch Linux Community
contributions forum some time ago (see
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=88997). As it AFAIK never
got a home, I considered to give it one here.
